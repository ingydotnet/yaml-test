YAML Test
=========

A Complete Sharable Test Suite for YAML

= Description

This is a comprehensive test suite for YAML. Each test case is a directory
under the `test/` directory. The `tag/` directory contains subdirectories that
are "tags" containing symlinks to test cases for that tag.

= File Names

Within a test case there are files that can be used for all sorts of testing:

* Parsing
* Loading
* Emitting
* Dumping
* Type resolution

The following file names are used:

- `test.yaml`

  A YAML input file, that is meant to be parsed and/or loaded depending on the
  test. It can also serve as the canonical output file if no `out.yaml` exists.

- `in.yaml`

  A YAML file that is meant as input only.

- `in-2.yaml`

  An alternate YAML input file that loads as the same JSON structure.

- `out.yaml`

  This is the YAML that a Dumper or Emitter is expected to produce.

- `out-perl-pm.yaml`

  This is the YAML that is expected to be produced using Perl's `YAML.pm`.

- `test.json`

  This is a JSON file that contains the equivalent data that the YAML should
  load into.

- `test.event`

  An event syntax, one event per line, that YAML would parse to or emit from.
